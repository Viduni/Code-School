	These are also Called as Access Visibility Controls  means they defined where a method 
	and Data Member of class will be used either inside a  class ,outside a class ,in inherited
	class or in main Method They Tells us the Scope of Methods where they would be used Various 
	types of Access Modifiers  are as follows:-
	 1) Public Access: - Public Access modifiers Specifies that data Members and Member 
		Functions those are declared as public will be visible in entire class in which they 
		are defined.  Public Modifier is used when we wants to use the method any where either 
		in the class or from outside the class.
	2) Protected Access:- The Methods those are declared as Protected Access modifiers are 
		Accessible to Only in the Sub Classes but not in the Main Program , This is the Most 
		important Access Modifiers which is used for Making a Data or Member Function as he 
		may only be Accessible to a Class which derives it but it doesnâ€™t allows a user to 
		Access the data which is declared as outside from Program Means Methods those are 
		Declared as Protected are Never be Accessible to Another Class The Protected will 
		be Accessible to Only Sub Class and but not in your Main Program. 
	 3) Private Access:- The Methods or variables those are declared as private Access 
		modifiers are not would be not Accessed outside from the class or in inherited Class 
		or the Subclass will not be able to use the Methods those are declared as Private 
		they are Visible only in same class where they are declared. By default all the 
		Data Members and Member Functions is Private, if we never specifies any Access 
		Modifier in front of the Member and Data Members Functions.<br>
	

			
	Example
	<a href="W.html">Class Student has private fields as student number and name.The method 
	display() in class Student displays as student number and name. Use constructor to
	assign values. Write a java program to set and display values of one student.</a><br>

	Example
	<a href="X.html">Class Employee has protected fields number and name.Class laborer 
	has a private field number of ot hours. The class also 	have a public method set()
