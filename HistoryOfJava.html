   <h1>History Of Java</h1>
 <pre id="pr1" align="justify">
The Java programming Language evolved from a language named Oak. Oak was developed in the early nineties at Sun Microsystems as a 
platform-independent language aimed at allowing entertainment appliances such as video game consoles and VCRs to communicate . 
Oak was first slated to appear in television set-top boxes designed to provide video-on-demand services. Just as the deals with 
the set-top box manufacturers were falling through, the World Wide Web was coming to life. As Oak’s developers began to re cognize
this trend, their focus shifted to the Internet and WebRunner, an Oak-enabled browser, was born. Oak’s name was changed to Java and
WebRunner became the HotJava web browser. The excitement of the Internet attracted software vendors such that Jav a development tools 
from many vendors quickly became available. That same excitement has provided the impetus for a multitude of software developers to 
discover Java and its many wonderful features.
